			<h2>About</h2>
			<p> I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China, and a visiting Ph.D. student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada. </p>
		        #<p> I enjoy every aspect of research, from learning/creating new knowledge to building collaborations and observing the confidence it brings to people. </p>
		        <p> For me, research is not only a means of acquiring wisdom but also a way to impart knowledge and motivate people, which I find deeply fulfilling.</p>
